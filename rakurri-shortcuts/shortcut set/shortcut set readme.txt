These are my shortcuts, keep in mind that they aren't objectively better than the defaults, they just make more sense in my head! 
Maybe they do for you too, so I wanted to share them! Under you can see a list of what is changed and why.

INSTALLATION
1. Go to "Settings"
2. Select "Configure Krita"
3. Select "Keyboard Shortcuts"
4. Make a new Shortcuts Scheme, and call it something of your choice. (I call mine RakurriScheme)
5. Select the new Shortcuts Scheme
6. Save/Load
7. Import Scheme


LIST OF CHANGED SHORTCUTS AND WHY I CHANGED THEM:
"_" means "unmapped"

Quit
Ctrl + Q -> _

Close
Ctrl + W -> _

Close All
Ctrl + Shift + W -> _

Reasoning: I want closing my documents to be as intentional as possible. I don't want to close on accident or do it out of habit.

Duplicate Layer or Mask
Ctrl + J -> Shift + D

Reasoning: I think "D" for "Duplicate" makes more sense, and is easier to reach! Also it's the same shortcut as in Blender so it fits my muscle memory.

Export
_ -> Ctrl + Alt + Shift + E

Reasoning: I want a shortcut for exporting, for some reason my mind wants to use an "E" for "Export" instead of using an "S" like the other save options. 

Decrease Brush Size
[ -> A

Increase Brush Size
] -> S

Reasoning: Nordic keyboards does not have dedicated "[" and "]" buttons,  and I want this to be easier to reach.

Contiguous Selection Tool
_ -> W

Similar Selection Tool
_ -> Ctrl + W

I use these from time to time, so I want them accessible. "W" for "Wand"

Outline Selection Tool
_ -> Q

Polygonal Selection Tool
_ -> Ctrl + Q

Reasoning: I use these a lot. "Q" almost looks like a lasso, and it is easy to reach!

Reference Image Tool
_ -> Shift + R

Assistant Tool
_ -> Shift + A

Reasoning: These deserve their own shortcuts, "R" for "Reference" and "A" for "Assistant".

Multibrush Tool
Q -> Shift + B

Reasoning: I want brush tools to all be assigned to "B" for "Brush". I rarely use the Multibrush so I want the easy to reach "Q" button for something else.

Transform
Ctrl + T -> T

Move
T -> Ctrl + T

Reasoning: I always use Transform and almost never use Move, so T should be used for the most useful!

Show Rulers
_ -> Ctrl +Alt + Shift + R

Selection Mode: Add
A -> _

Selection Mode: Substract
S -> _

Selection Mode: Replace
R -> _

Reasoning: I use modifiers to do the same job, so I want to have the easy to reach "A", "S" and "R" buttons mapped to something else.

Invert Selection
Ctrl + Shift + I -> I

Reasoning: I use this from time to time, so I want it to be an easier shortcut than less used features.

Invert
Ctrl + I -> Ctrl + Shift + I 

Reasoning: I very rarely use Invert

Reset Foreground and Background Color
D -> _

Decrease Opacity 
I -> _

Increase Opacity 
O -> _

Make brush color lighter
L -> _

Make Brush color darker
K -> _

Reasoning: I never use these and I want to have more available keys to map.
