Sharing my brushes for Krita!
Keep in mind that the V1.1 version is an addon to the original (V1.0), make sure to install both!

I hope you'll enjoy the brush pack! :)
Feel free to use the brushes in your own artworks! No need to credit me!

Here is a video preview of V1.0:

TILT SUPPORT/IF BRUSHES DON'T WORK AS IN THE VIDEO:

Most of my brushes are based on tilt support, because that is a feature I really enjoy using!
The negative side of this, is that they won’t work well on some tablets and screen devices that does not support it!
But there is a way to make them work! Here is a quick tutorial on how to convert the brushes to work decent without having tilt support:
 
First go to the “Edit brush settings” icon in the top bar or press F5, then enter the “Rotation” settings
 
Turn on “Drawing angle”, and then turn off “Tilt direction”!
If you wish, you can click “Overwrite Brush” to make these changes permanent!
